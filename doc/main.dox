/// @mainpage "demo2" Binary Protocol Library
/// @tableofcontents
/// This generated code implements "demo2" binary protocol using various
/// classes from
/// <a href="https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library">COMMS Library</a>.@n
/// Below is a short summary of generated classes.
/// Please refer to <b>"How to Use Defined Custom Protocol"</b> page of its documentation
/// for detailed explanation on how to use them.
///
/// @b NOTE, that the generated protocol code is mostly declarative statements
/// of classes and types definitions. It is self explanatory and easy to read.
/// In many cases it is easier to read and understand the generated code, than the
/// doxygen generated documentation. Please spend some time on browsing around
/// and looking at the generated code in addition to reading this documentation.
///
/// @section main_messages Available Message Classes
/// The following namespaces contain all the classes describing available messages:
/// @li @ref demo2::message (residing in @b demo2/message directory).
///
/// @section main_fields Available Common Fields
/// The following namespaces contain all definition of all the fields,
/// which can be references by multiple messages:
/// @li @ref demo2::field (residing in @b demo2/field directory).
///
/// @section main_interfaces Common Interface Classes
/// The available common interface classes are:
/// @li @ref demo2::Message from @b demo2/Message.h header file).
///
/// @section main_frames Frame (Protocol Stack) Classes
/// The available frame (protocol stack) classes are:
/// @li @ref demo2::frame::Frame from @b demo2/frame/Frame.h header file).
///
/// Every frame class/type definition receives (as a template parameter) a list of
/// @b input message types it is expected to recognize. Default defintion
/// uses @ref demo2::AllMessages (defined in @b demo2/AllMessages.h).
/// @n If protocol defines any uni-directional message, then it is recommended to use
/// either @ref demo2::ServerInputMessages (from @b demo2/ServerInputMessages.h)
/// or @ref demo2::ClientInputMessages  (from @b demo2/ClientInputMessages.h)
///
/// @section main_customization Customization
/// Depending on the value of @b customization option passed to the @b commsdsl2comms
/// code generator, the latter generates @ref demo2::DefaultOptions
/// struct (defined in @b  demo2/DefaultOptions.h file),
/// which is used by default thoughout the protocol definition classes.
/// The struct contains all the available type definition, which can be used to
/// customize default data structures and/or behaviour of various classes.
/// If any additional customization is required, just recreate similar struct with
/// relevant types overriden with new definition. The easiest way is to extend
/// the demo2::DefaultOptions. For example:
/// @code
/// struct MyOptions : public demo2::DefaultOptions
/// {
///     struct field : public demo2::DefaultOptions::field
///     {
///         // use comms::util::StaticString as storage type
///         using SomeStringField = comms::option::FixedSizeStorage<32>;
///     };
/// };
/// @endcode
/// @b NOTE, that inner scope of structs in the demo2::DefaultOptions
/// resembles scope of namespaces used in protocol definition.
///
/// The @b COMMS library also provides a flexible way to configure polymorphic
/// interface for the message classes. If the defined protocol has multiple
/// uni-directional messages (marked using @b sender property in the schema),
/// then it is recommended to define two separate interfaces: one for input,
/// other for output:
/// @code
/// using MyInputMsg =
///    demo2::Message<
///        comms::option::ReadIterator<const std::uint8_t*>, // for polymorphic read
///        comms::option::Handler<MyHandler> // for polymorphic dispatch
///    >;
///
/// using MyOutputMsg =
///    demo2::Message<
///        comms::option::WriteIterator<std::uint8_t*>, // for polymorphic write
///        comms::option::LengthInfoInterface, // for polymorphic serialisation length retrieval
///        comms::option::IdInfoInterface // for polymorphic message ID retrieval
///    >;
/// @endcode
/// In case there are only few uni-directional messages, it may make sence to define
/// single interface class:
/// @code
/// using MyMsg =
///    demo2::Message<
///        comms::option::ReadIterator<const std::uint8_t*>, // for polymorphic read
///        comms::option::Handler<MyHandler> // for polymorphic dispatch
///        comms::option::WriteIterator<std::uint8_t*>, // for polymorphic write
///        comms::option::LengthInfoInterface, // for polymorphic serialisation length retrieval
///        comms::option::IdInfoInterface // for polymorphic message ID retrieval
///    >;
/// @endcode
/// In this case the code generator may also define demo2::ServerDefaultOptions
/// (check for existence of demo2/ServerDefaultOptions.h file) and
/// demo2::ClientDefaultOptions (check for existence of demo2/ClientDefaultOptions.h file).
/// These structs suppress generation of unnecessary virtual functions which are not
/// going to be used. Consiger using this structs as options instead of default
/// demo2::DefaultOptions.
///
/// @section main_version Version Dependent Code
/// The generated code is version dependent. The version information is stored in
/// one of the fields held by a common interface class (see @ref main_interfaces).
/// When presence of the field depends on the protocol version, it is defined as
/// @b comms::field::Optional field which wraps a proper field definition. Please
/// remember to use @b field() member function to access the wrapped field, before
/// using @b value() member function to access the actual value.
/// @code
/// void handle(SomeMessage& msg)
/// {
///     auto& versionDependentField = msg.field_someVersionDependentField();
///     auto& wrappedField = versionDependentField.field();
///     auto actualValue = wrappedField.value();
///     ...
/// }
/// @endcode
/// Every default constructed message will have a version of the schema with
/// all relevant fields being marked present/missing based on this version information.
/// If there is a need to send a message with different protocol version information,
/// the message needs to be brought into a consistent state by calling its @b doRefresh()
/// member function (or @b refresh() in case of proper polymorphic behavior has been enabled)
/// after version information has been updated.
/// @code
///     demo2::message::SomeMsg<MyOutputMsg> msg;
///     msg.version() = 4U;
///     msg.doRefresh(); // will update exists/missing state of every dependent field
/// @endcode
